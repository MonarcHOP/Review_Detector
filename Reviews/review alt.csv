17,"Video quality if superb, fits just fine, looks like a real mirror (I believe they enhanced this), my only gripe is I wish they put the cameras not side by side, but one on one side, the other on the other side. I only say this because due to where the left camera is place, there is wasted recording room when you start to turn it towards the driver side. Otherwise very happy with this so far.",Neutral

Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />I was told the enormous benifit of Oregano: it is one of the most powerful healing herbs and natural anti-biotics ever studied. It has been found in a recent study to be significantly better than all of the 18 currently used anti-biotics in the treatment of MRSA staph infections. The strong phenol anti-oxidants destroy pathogenic bacteria, viruses and yeasts. This super herb is very rich in anti-oxidant phytochemical flavonoids and phenolic acids. It is the third highest herb in oxygen radical absorbancy capacity (ORAC) with an impressive score of 200,129. The USDA ranks oregano's antioxidant capacity anywhere from 3 to 20 times higher than any other herb.<br /><br />You can see 2 bottles Oreganol P73 in my fridge. Wowww ... this oregano oil is just the best, it works miraculously! I had discomfort and dryness in my throat, then I took a couple drops of this oil in a tablespoon of water and drank it. This oil healed and soothed my throat almost instantly, and feel great up to now. Another time I felt my body so aching, then I took this oil in the same way - it set me free and felt great just in seconds. This oil is fantastic!!! I also have used oregano as emergency medicine to completely eliminate digestive distress after eating what I found out was contaminated food.",Positive

Since getting this, Ive havent had any issues sleeping through it! lol. It looks like a mini bra because its not like your traditional flat sleep masks that lay flat over your eyes. This one has little &#34;cups&#34; that doesnt touch your eyelids at all which is nice because with my old sleep mask it made me itchy. The only reason why I didnt give this 5 stars is because whenever I turned to sleep on my sides it kinda made it uncomfortable to sleep with it on. I had to sleep on my back to make it stay on.

65,This is a SMOKING HOT deal. This is the second unit in the last 2-3 weeks They work when you first plug them in but watch out. Somewhere between 1-5 charge cycles these things get so hot you can't touch them. Then they pop and smoke.....game over. No more charging.   The only reason I am giving this a 1 star is the returns have been easy. Reading all of the reviews it looks like about 1 in 3 are good chargers. I'm going to step up and pay the $$$$ for a real one this time.  Don't want to risk burning down the house over a $30 difference between junk and genuine Apple product.

70,"$50 for some stinky tablets. Nothing, nada, no effect whatsoever. It's taking me awhile to write a review because I was trying to give them time to work. It wasn't until I landed up in the hospital (Not Because Of This Product) that I realized I blew 50 bucks. The Doc asked me all that I was taking and I gladly told him about this product thinking maybe it was the cause of my hospital stay (It was pneumonia) He and the nurse both sensed my fear and promptly me told me they were just glorified vitamins with big cheesy smiles on their faces.

75,"This company sent me a email after i purchased this on eBay and asked me to review the product on amazon.  They probably should have asked me first what i thought, but here it goes. I bought it for use with my appradio3 and paid an additional $20 to have it installed. After about 2 days, it would not allow video to display constantly and just kept flashing between the warning message and the video about every 6 or 7 seconds. It was like one second of video followed by 6-7 seconds of warning message. It would do it over and over and got really annoying. I took it back to my installer, and they said it was installed correctly. I had no amps, or other stuff and my car does not need a radio module (older car here with no fancy computer stuff except for new pioneer radio). I agreed to an additional $30 removal to have the bypass bench tested and it did the same thing on the bench. The installer fed power to the blue and black wires, and connected an alarm led to the green wire. It did the same flashing on the bench it did in the car. For $20, i dont want to deal with the hassle of returning it, but it cost me more out of pocket and time to make it worth it. I do not know if the seller should be responsible for this, but i did lose out a lot of money due to their product so I am not sure if I should pursue it. I ended up buying another bypass from another company, and it has worked fine for over a month now. Maybe I just got a bad one or what, but it sucked to have to deal with it. Just my $.02 so take it or leave it. My emails to the company through their website still have went unanswered to date, and its been weeks. I searched online about this and diybypass is really a no-name company so go figure.",Neutral

She can say circle and star now, and recognizes some others when she plays with her [[ASIN:B0089W1IGG Baby's First Blocks]]. She can also count from one to five, and names a few letters here and there.<br /><br />I give the videos credit that they hold her attention and she has learned a lot from them. They are slow paced and not too flashy like most cartoons on TV. The animations are colorful and the music is decent.<br /><br />However, they get boring for adults to watch. The videos repeat the word over and over again, which gets tiring for me to listen to. In all fairness the repetition definitely helps her to learn faster so I guess I should just deal with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* The videos work well.<br />* My daughter loves them.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Boring for adults to watch.",Positive

I tried it on the driver's seat as well and it's perfect. It helps me relaxed my back don't need to actually pull the driver's seat forward. I think I made a great decision in buying this Lumbar cushion. The only thing that I'm worried is the durability of this cushion.

114,"We changed from swaddlers to cruisers when our baby started to crawl excessively. The diapers moved with her better and gave a lot better coverage. Swaddlers were not so leak proof with an active baby. I think she also likes the these better- she seems to smile when she sees them. There've been some changes in the last pack compared to original cruisers though. There liner is the same color as the diaper again and they're thinner. Sometimes the thinner consistency poses a problem, sometimes it does not. It really depends on the day and how much she's gotta go.<br /><br />They seem to hold well overnight- no leaks, but it's not as dry either. As a result, our poor little Lucy has got some diaper rash a few times. She's a screamer when she's got it bad. In those instances we use a heavy strength rash cream by bourdeaux butt paste brand: [[ASIN:B00BMIT1U4 All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste Diaper Rash Ointment + FREE Aveeno Baby Daily Moisture Lotion]].

119,"There's a lot of mixed reviews...I just want to start by saying each diaper is going to work differently on each baby! They're not all shaped the same, they don't all go to the bathroom the same. It takes patience to find the right diaper for your baby. Just because my friend prefers swaddlers doesn't mean I do too. The Pampers Baby Dry is a good fit for my child. She's pretty small and long. I've noticed my friends with fuller, thicker babies don't have as much good luck. But for me, this is a great, thin, super-absorbant diaper that works well. The price is a great value as well.<br /><br />Be aware though, no diaper will elimnate diaper rash! Despite how absorbant your diaper choice is, your baby will still at some point have diaper rash. My best luck has been butt paste diaper cream ([[ASIN:B00BMIVQ3E All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste + FREE Baby Ganics Thick N' Kleen (Fragrance Free) Baby Wipes]]) because it seals up the sensitive skin and I can still re-diaper my girl right away without a lot of fuss. With diaper rash and rash cream, make sure the diaper doesn't rub anywhere to hard and that they've got some flexibility. The Baby Dry leaves plenty of room for my baby.",Positive

156,"I am a collector of fitness products, there are three exercise cards on the market (Workout Labs, Strength Stack 52 and Fit Deck) and I will post a brief review of all three here. Just a bit about myself, I am 5 foot 10 somewhat athletic and would consider myself a little above average in terms of my fitness level.<br />Fit Deck<br />Fit Deck has been around for a few years now. I would place them second behind Strength Stack 52 in terms of the quality of workout you can get with these. They have a ton of different decks like bodyweight and basketball and even tai chi, to be fair, I only purchased the bodyweight cards though. Like Workout Labs the exercises were still very basic and lacked the neat gaming component that Strength Stack provides. The owner is a former navy seal (from many years ago), which helps the product, but if you look at him, he has very little muscle tone, which gets me a bit weary.<br />About $16/deck, not very happy with these since they lack any benefit for someone of intermediate or advanced fitness level. If you are a beginner and have no knowledge of working out, you can get these cards, but again, no reason to buy them if Strength Stacks are in stock.<br />Strength Stack 52<br />In my opinion the best of the three workout card companies. From the design to the game play, these cards have some really neat features. Every card has a QR code. The code can be scanned with any Smartphone and a video of the exercise on the card will show me how to do the exercise. Each card is numbered and suited and even color coded by body type. The website has some cool games you can play with the cards, but my buddy and I made up a few of our own. The inventor of the cards, Sergeant Volkin is a military fitness expert and you can tell by looking at him.<br />The best feature of these cards is the exercises themselves. Both Fit Deck and Workout Labs have very basic exercises, Strength Stack has exercises that are dynamic and fun, some of which I have neverseen before.<br />About $16/deck, really great deal, these are the cards I still use months after my purchase.<br />Workout Labs<br />This is the worst of the three exercise cards available. The creator of the cards has no muscle tone, no background in fitness or extraordinary fitness level (to my knowledge) , these cards are purely a marketing play as the owner outright claims he is a designer only. The cards are very, very basic, appealing only to beginners. When I got my cards in the mail, I noticed they were of good quality and waterproof in case you drip sweat on them. But, I have yet to sweat using these cards.<br />PLEASE NOTE: The reviews on this product are fake. I have clicked on almost all of the 5 star reviews and everyone one of them have only reviewed this product. You can even tell they are fake by the way they are written, a bit too perfect. That got me wary of purchasing the cards in the first place, but I still did.<br />The cards are divided into a male and female deck, which is  odd since fitness is unisex. There was nothing to do when I got the cards besides flip a card and look at the illustrations. Given the fact that they were $25 for a single deck of cards, I was hoping for much, much more as there are only 40 basic exercises in the deck. All in all, very disappointed with these.<br /><br />I hope this review helped, I was not paid in any way to review any of these companies.",Neutral

After speaking with my Dr about the pain, he said that I should look at Glucosamine supplements to see if they could help. So over the past few months I have tried a few other products I found in GNC like Instaflex, and GNC's own Triflex and while I noticed a slight difference with each of them I just continued looking to find something that would help noticeably alleviate the pain. I hate taking aspirin and ibuprofen as they both have a tendency to upset my stomach, and like the fact that it is more natural. My running partner recommended this to me, and what I noticed was that it really helped with the pain. I wouldn't say that the relief came immediately, but over about a week I noticed that the pain in my joints was much less, and my joints began to have just a more &#34;smooth&#34; feeling while running. I don't know how else to describe it, but I just don't get that rough feeling I would usually get after a week of running.

282,"The premise of And Only to Deceive excited me enough to get a copy the very same day I first heard about it. The idea of a reverse love story, a woman falling in love with the man she married only after his death, married with the mystery/suspense, as well as the Victorian setting appealed to me very much.<br /><br />Alexander portrayed the romantic part of the romantic suspense in an elegant and intelligent manner. Through reading his journals, Emily is astounded to discover that the ordinary aristocrat she thought she had married harbored passionate love for her and was far more interesting than she knew. This made me question Emily's intelligence and powers of observation, though. Was she so self-absorbed that she didn't take the time to get to know the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with? The more she finds out about Phillip, the more regret grows until Emily falls in love with her dead husband and begins to truly mourn him. Rather than letting her heroine lionize Philip, without question, Alexander then begins to poke holes in his character and Emily's idolatry of him. In keeping with Emily's newfound interest in Greek antiquities and Greek literature, there is a long-running discourse throughout the book regarding who is the better hero, Achilles or Hector. Alexander uses this discourse in subtle comparison to Emily's love for her dead husband - the man she never knew and built up in her mind as an incomparable demi-god (like Achilles) with her flawed (but alive) suitors (like Hector, a human who dares battle Achilles, protected by the gods, to protect his kingdom).<br /><br />I liked Alexander's exploration of Emily's liminal role in Victorian society as a widow, neither mother or wife or virgin bride-to-be. She comes to the realization that without a husband, yet with his fortune, she is basically a free woman, able to do as she pleases within or even out of society.<br /><br />Emily's character, however, made no emotional connection with me. Other than being very beautiful, so much so that her dead husband's secret nickname for her was Kallista (the most beautiful) and being an avid reader, she was not very interesting. I could not see why sophisticated Philip fell in love with her; however, Alexander shows that perhaps, like Emily falling in love with the dead Philip, Philip also fell in love with a figment of his own romantic imagination. He didn't know her, but chose her for her beauty, as Paris chose Helen for hers.<br /><br />Emily develops, however, throughout the course of the story. Initially inspired by her husband's interests, she develops interests of her own: Greek antiquities, learning ancient Greek, the epic poems. She also explores her newfound freedom as an independent woman of means.<br /><br />""Dissatisfied, I put down the book, irritated that Philip was not there. I desperately wanted the chance to argue about these things with him. As I sat there, I slowly began to realize that my own opinions were quite different from those of my husband. Until then I had attributed all my interest in classical antiquity to Phillip and had assumed that his own studies would serve as an adequate guide for mine. I no longer felt driven to study as a way to know Phillip. I wanted to study because I loved the poetry, because the beauty of Greek sculpture moved me...""<br /><br />The suspense part of the novel was lackluster and slow-moving. While I liked the discussion of Greek antiquities and details of the Impressionist art movement, I was never gripped with the fervent need to get to the bottom of whodonit. The sequels sound like they're set in some amazing locales; however, I don't believe I will be continuing this series.",Positive

Second day the charge controller broke for no apparent reason, I just saw it broken and since I couldn't fix it myself -I called support - which, by the way, was not helpful. I returned the panels and asked for a refund, because they didn't wrote in the description how fragile these were :/.<br /><br />I listened to my friend's advice, who's a solar repairman, and I bought, like he did, a Suntastic Charger ( http://amzn.to/1Ad27Vf ) which I received 4 days ago.

I find it provides the client with a better experience overall, especially working on their backs. My ultimate forumla is to use almond oil on fair areas and jojoba oil on the rougher areas like hands, elbows, or feet. Jojoba oil is awesome- [[ASIN:B00AJFV8L6 NOW Foods Sweet Almond Oil - 16 oz. + FREE Desert Essence Pure Jojoba Oil -- 4 fl oz]].
